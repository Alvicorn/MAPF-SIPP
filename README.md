# MAPF-SIPP


## Getting Started
This repo is designed to run in a [VS Code Devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

The following steps are for initializing the development environment:
1. Pull the latest Docker image
    ```bash
    docker pull alvicorn/mapf-sipp:latest
    ```
2. Open the repo in VS Code and _rebuild as devcontainer_ if necessary. (VS Code normally detects the `.devcontainer/` and will open it according)
